I've created a password manager with the following features:

- Add and store passwords with titles, usernames, and optional website URLs
- Generate secure random passwords
- Copy credentials to clipboard with one click
- Basic encryption for stored passwords (Note: in a production environment, you'd want to use a more secure encryption method)
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Clean and modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile

The passwords are stored locally in the browser's localStorage with basic encryption.

The password strength meter will help users create stronger passwords by providing immediate visual feedback. The new dark theme also reduces eye strain while maintaining a professional look.
